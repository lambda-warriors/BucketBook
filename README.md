## Proposal

### What problem does your app solve?
There is a strong need in the trip taking community to consolidate their adventure and share it with the ones they care about. As of right now, one would have to jump through hoops to share the content and update their travel lists simultaneously.

### Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
Allows user to plan out bucket list trips and cross them off their list.  Also allows them to add photos, videos, and journal entries that can be shared with friends and family within the selected group

### What is the mission statement?
“To serve as a home for those who crave travel and adventure.”
Features

##Features

### What features are required for your minimum viable product?

* As a user I want to log in to my bucket list so I can see the items on my list in a grid format. 
* As a user I want to be able to create a bucket list item. 
* As a user I want to be able to share my bucket list with other users (family members) so that they can add items to it as well. 
* As I user I want to be able to click an item so that I can mark it as done, add photos, journal entries. 

### What features may you wish to put in a future release?

* A map feature in which you can plan and update trips in real time so that your friends and family can know where you are and where you’ve been.  Also for each stop on your trip you can add pictures and journal entries specific to the location.

### What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

* Day one Journal: Allows the user to journal what is going on around them in any given time. Not specific to traveling.
* Travel Diaries: Allows the user to share features from the trip with whoever they want. Has a map function. Can turn your journal entry into a blog and print it out and make it a book.
* Driftr: A place to share photos and videos of your trip to the app that can be viewed by anyone.  Instagram for travelers.

## Frameworks - Libraries

### What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
#### FOR REACT DEV
Styled-components { allows us to pass props to each component we create through state and make the user interface more user oriented by allowing the to customize their experience }, 
react-bootstrap { simple lightweight framework library for modals and more advanced components that would take long to create}, 
axios { for our api .get.post requests } , 
Formik & Yup { for getting user information easily to the server }, 
react-router-dom { makes our page easily navigable }

### Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
No i have a local API that the user will access during the time period of development {FE } 

### Are you required to pay to use the API?
No We are accessing a local api for the moment {FE }

### Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)

## For Data Scientists

### Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
### You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
### Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
### A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

## Target Audience

### Who is your target audience? Be specific.

* People who have bucket lists and want to share their completed trips with specific people.

### What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

### Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

## Research

### Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

## Prototype Key Feature(s)

### this is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
