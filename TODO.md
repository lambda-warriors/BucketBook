    * `cd` into project;
    * then  `yarn install`;
    * then `yarn start`

### console should now say 
        ` node server listening on port 8000` or something like that :) axios like normal to https://localhost:3000 or 
            if that doesnt work 
            open command prompt 
            `ipconfig`
            then find the ipv4 address should look something like 192.268.0.13
            then just puth that in place of the localhost hash likst :::   https://192.268.0.13:3000 
            and it should connect to the server
